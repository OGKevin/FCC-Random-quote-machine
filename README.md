##Random Quote Machine 
A FCC project. (https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine)

As explained on the FCC webiste the user should be able to do the follwoing:
*  I can click a button to show me a new random quote.
* I can press a button to tweet out a quote.

I remade their example. (https://ogkevin.github.io/FCC-Random-quote-machine/)

##Known bugs

* For some reason Gitpages is not loading the ./JSON/HEXColor.json file and therefore is the background color not changing like in the FCC example. Works fine on local testing.
